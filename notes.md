2. Using jQuery, append a `<div>` element when you click the button. It should append a new div each time you click the button.

TO DO
append a new div each time

3. Inside the `<div>` element you created in the previous step, create a `<p>` element that shows how many times you have clicked the "Generate" button from the first step. It should reflect the count for that step - the first div you made should be 1, the second 2, etc. (You can use the same append from the previous step)

4. Inside the `<div>` element created in step two, append two `<button>` elements with text of "Yellow" & "Delete". (You can use the same append from the previous step)

5. In a CSS file, any `<div>` created using the "Generate" button should start with red as it's `background-color`.

6. Clicking a "Yellow" `<button>` should change its parent `background-color` from red to yellow.

7. Clicking a "Delete" `<button>` should remove its parent `<div>` and that `<div>s` children (including the clicked on "Delete" button). 

No need to do anything beyond the challenge described above. Once you are complete, check your code into a GitHub repo and submit via this application.
